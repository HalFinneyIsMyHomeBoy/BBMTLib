# nodns-server

A DNS server implementation that resolves `.nostr` domains using Nostr events.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è üö® CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING üö® ‚ö†Ô∏è

**THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION WITH AUTOMATIC CERTIFICATE INSTALLATION**

### EXTREME DANGER - USE WITH CAUTION

This server can **AUTOMATICALLY MODIFY YOUR SYSTEM'S CERTIFICATE TRUST STORE** without explicit user consent on each certificate. This functionality is **EXTREMELY DANGEROUS** and can:

- ‚úÖ **COMPROMISE YOUR SYSTEM SECURITY**
- ‚úÖ **ALLOW MALICIOUS ACTORS TO INTERCEPT YOUR ENCRYPTED TRAFFIC**  
- ‚úÖ **BREAK TLS/SSL SECURITY FOR YOUR ENTIRE SYSTEM**
- ‚úÖ **ENABLE MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE ATTACKS**
- ‚úÖ **BYPASS BROWSER SECURITY WARNINGS**

### What This Means

When this server fetches certificates from Nostr events, it can:
1. Add arbitrary certificates to your system's trusted certificate store
2. Make your system trust certificates signed by unknown/untrusted entities
3. Override security protections in browsers and applications
4. Create security vulnerabilities system-wide

### Before You Run This Software

**ONLY USE THIS SOFTWARE IF:**
- ‚úÖ You are a developer testing in an isolated environment
- ‚úÖ You understand the security implications fully
- ‚úÖ You are prepared to manually audit every certificate
- ‚úÖ You can restore your system if compromised
- ‚úÖ You are NOT running this on production systems
- ‚úÖ You are NOT running this on systems with sensitive data

**NEVER USE THIS SOFTWARE IF:**
- ‚ùå You don't fully understand certificate authorities and PKI
- ‚ùå You're running this on a production system
- ‚ùå You have sensitive data on the system
- ‚ùå You're not prepared to deal with security compromises
- ‚ùå You can't verify the integrity of certificates yourself

### Recommended Safety Measures

1. **Run in isolated VMs only**
2. **Never use on your primary workstation**
3. **Monitor certificate installations carefully**
4. **Have a system restore plan ready**
5. **Disable auto-certificate installation by default**
6. **Manually review each certificate before installation**

## Features

- DNS resolution for `.nostr` domains using Nostr kind 11111 events
- Support for multiple DNS record types (A, AAAA, CNAME, TXT, MX, SRV, etc.)
- **[DANGEROUS]** Automatic certificate fetching from Nostr kind 30003 events
- **[DANGEROUS]** Cross-platform trust store integration
- Forwarding of non-nostr domains to upstream DNS servers

## Installation

‚ö†Ô∏è **READ THE SECURITY WARNING ABOVE FIRST** ‚ö†Ô∏è

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/nostr-dns
cd nostr-dns/nodns-server

# Build
go build -o nodns-server

# Run (DANGEROUS - see warnings above)
sudo ./nodns-server
```

## Configuration

```yaml
# config.yaml
port: 5354
relays:
  - "wss://relay.damus.io"
  - "wss://nos.lol"
  - "wss://relay.snort.social"
forward_dns:
  - "1.1.1.1"
  - "1.0.0.1"
ttl: 3600

# Certificate settings (DANGEROUS)
certificates:
  auto_install: false    # KEEP THIS FALSE FOR SAFETY
  prompt_user: true      # KEEP THIS TRUE FOR SAFETY
  skip_expired: true
  skip_self_signed: false  # Self-signed certs can be dangerous too
```

## Usage

### Safe Mode (Recommended)
```bash
# Run with certificate installation disabled
./nodns-server -cert-auto-install=false -cert-prompt=true
```

### Dangerous Mode (Experts Only)
```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è DANGER: Auto-installs certificates without prompting
./nodns-server -cert-auto-install=true
```

### Testing DNS Resolution
```bash
# Query DNS records
dig @localhost -p 5354 npub1abc.nostr A

# Test certificate fetching (will prompt for installation)
dig @localhost -p 5354 npub1secure.nostr A
```

## How It Works

1. **DNS Query**: Client queries for `npub1abc.nostr`
2. **Pubkey Extraction**: Extract pubkey from npub
3. **Nostr Query**: Fetch both kind 11111 (DNS records) and kind 30003 (certificates) events
4. **DNS Response**: Generate DNS response from record tags
5. **Certificate Installation**: **[DANGEROUS]** Automatically install found certificates

## Event Formats

### DNS Records (kind 11111)
```json
{
  "kind": 11111,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["record", "A", "@", "1.2.3.4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "3600"]
  ]
}
```

### Certificates (kind 30003) - ‚ö†Ô∏è DANGEROUS ‚ö†Ô∏è
```json
{
  "kind": 30003,
  "content": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "nostr"],
    ["expiry", "1735689600"]
  ]
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Certificate Validation
This software attempts to validate certificates, but validation can be bypassed or may contain bugs. **Never rely solely on automated validation.**

### Trust Store Modifications
Modifying system trust stores is a **privileged operation** that can compromise system security. This software requires administrative privileges and can make system-wide security changes.

### Nostr Event Authenticity
While Nostr events are cryptographically signed, this doesn't guarantee the certificates contained within them are trustworthy or legitimate.

## Platform Support

- ‚úÖ macOS (requires admin privileges)
- ‚úÖ Linux (requires sudo)  
- ‚úÖ Windows (requires administrator privileges)

## Development

### Build Requirements
- Go 1.21+
- Administrative privileges for certificate operations

### Testing
```bash
# Unit tests
go test ./...

# Integration tests (DANGEROUS - modifies trust store)
go test -tags=integration ./...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate Installation Fails
- Check if running with appropriate privileges
- Verify certificate format and validity
- Check system trust store accessibility

### DNS Resolution Issues
- Verify relay connectivity
- Check event format compliance
- Monitor relay response times

## Contributing

**Please be extremely careful when contributing to certificate-related code.** Security vulnerabilities in this area can compromise entire systems.

1. All certificate-related PRs require thorough security review
2. Test only in isolated environments
3. Document security implications of changes
4. Consider the principle of least privilege
